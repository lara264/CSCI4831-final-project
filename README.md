# CSCI4831 Final Project

Lara Chunko and Ryan Drew, 2021


## Installation

Installation ain't too bad. We use poetry for managing dependencies and 
installation. Just make sure you have Python 3.8 and ``poetry`` 
installed (i.e. ``pip install poetry``) and run the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lara264/CSCI4831-final-project
$ cd CSCI-final-project
$ poetry install
```
